Javascript is a dynamically typed programming language.
All languages in which we can change the data type of a variable during program are called dynamically typed programming languages.
Example: Python, Javascript, ...., etc
Example code: (python)
x = "karachi"
print(x)
x = 3
print(x)
Above code is absolutely valid.

There is another type: static typed programming language.
All languages in which we have to define the data type of a variable before of it being used are called static typed programming languages.
Example: C, C++, ...., etc

JavaScript is a case sensitive programming language.
